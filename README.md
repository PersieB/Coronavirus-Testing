# Coronavirus-Testing
How are continents using testing and lockdown to fight COVID? - as of 15th November 2020.

The motivation for this project comes from a Twitter thread by Max Roser from our World in Data. In this thread, Max argues that the best approach
to containing the virus is one that tests appropriately. The interesting thing about Max's proposal is that he provides an approach that could be 
used to measure how effectively countries are testing.The idea is that like South Korea and other countries that have succeeded to contain the virus
better than the rest of the world, a large number of tests are carried for each reported case of COVID-19. The ratio of positive cases to the number of
tests in these countries can be well below 1%. A country is, therefore, able to contain the virus well, and can be said to be testing effectively if the
ratio of it's total positive cases to its total number of tests carried out is small.

In this project, I attempt to answer the question, "Up till now, is there a relationship between GDP per capita and the ability to test for COVID-19 effectively?".
Because the pandemic is still effective, I only studied the relationship between these variables up to a certain date, and admit that countries around the world may
significantly alter their approaches with time.
